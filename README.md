**joyjitchatterjee/joyjitchatterjee** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

I am a Final Year PhD. Computer Science Researcher at the University of Hull, United Kingdom. My present research spans the domain of tackling climate change with AI, wherein, I develop specialised AI techniques to help make make wind energy sources more reliable, through explainable and intelligent decision support in their operations & maintenance. My research interests span Deep Learning, Natural Language Generation, Data Analytics, Causal Inference and Time-Series Analysis. Feel free to check out my personal website at http://joyjitchatterjee.github.io for more details on my past and present works.

I am also an avid blogger, and many of my Github repos are supplement to my Medium articles, so if you would like, please give them a read at http://joyjitece.medium.com. Some of the repos contain supplementary material for my research publications, some are simple and plain fun projects, while a few are an effort to contribute to the community by facilitating educational content in Computer Science & Engineering. I love to code in Python and C++ and these are the programming languages you would find most of my repos to be based on, although I have studied other areas of programming as well, including MATLAB, R, Java/Javascript and HTML/CSS, Electronic Design & Automation HDL's such as System Verilog, VHDL but do not use them too frequently.
